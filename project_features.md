# IoT Data Sharing using Blockchains: Feature List

This document outlines the **features** we are going to implement for the **IoT Data Sharing using Blockchains** project. The features are categorized into **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** levels to ensure a structured and phased implementation.

---

## **Basic Features**
These are the **core functionalities** that form the foundation of the project.

### 1. **Decentralized Data Ownership**
- Tokenize IoT datasets as **NFTs (ERC-721)** to ensure ownership and provenance.
- Each dataset is represented as a unique NFT on the blockchain.

### 2. **Immutable Data Storage**
- Store datasets on **IPFS/Filecoin** for decentralized and tamper-proof storage.
- Link IPFS hashes to NFTs for data integrity.

### 3. **Smart Contract-Based Marketplace**
- Enable users to **list, buy, and sell datasets** using smart contracts.
- Implement escrow-based payments for secure transactions.

### 4. **Transparent Transactions**
- Record all transactions (e.g., listings, purchases) on the blockchain.
- Use smart contract events for logging and auditing.

### 5. **User Authentication**
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** for secure user login and registration.
- Store user credentials securely in a database.

### 6. **Dataset Listings**
- Display datasets with **search and filter options** (e.g., by category, price, or data type).
- Paginate results for large datasets.

### 7. **Dataset Previews**
- Allow buyers to preview a sample of the dataset before purchasing.
- Use modals or popups for previews.

### 8. **Wallet Integration**
- Integrate **MetaMask** for crypto payments and authentication.
- Handle wallet authentication and transactions using **Ethers.js**.

## **Intermediate Features**
These features add **complexity and functionality** to the project.

### 1. **Access Control**
- Restrict dataset access to **verified buyers** using smart contracts.
- Grant access permissions based on ownership and payment status.

### 2. **Royalties and Resale**
- Automatically distribute **royalties** to original sellers on dataset resales.
- Track resales and distribute royalties using smart contracts.

### 3. **Data Verification**
- Verify the **quality and authenticity** of IoT data before listing.
- Use digital signatures to ensure data integrity.

### 4. **Metadata Management**
- Store dataset metadata (e.g., title, description, price) in a database for fast retrieval.
- Link metadata to the corresponding NFT.

### 5. **Transaction History**
- Show users their **purchase and sale history**.
- Fetch and display transaction data from the blockchain.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- Ensure the app works seamlessly on **desktop and mobile devices**.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling.

### 7. **Data Encryption**
- Encrypt sensitive IoT data before storing it on IPFS.
- Decrypt data only for authorized users.

---

## **Advanced Features**
These features add **innovation and complexity** to the project, making it stand out.

### 1. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Data Sharing**
- Enable users to share datasets directly using **libp2p**.
- Integrate with IPFS for decentralized file sharing.

### 2. **Network Latency Simulation**
- Simulate network latency to demonstrate the impact of slow connections on data transfers.
- Add a latency slider on the frontend.

### 3. **Bandwidth Throttling**
- Simulate bandwidth limitations during dataset downloads.
- Display real-time metrics (e.g., transfer speed, time remaining).

### 4. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
- Allow buyers to verify dataset quality **without accessing the data**.
- Use **zk-SNARKs** or **zk-STARKs** for privacy-preserving verification.

### 5. **Gamification**
- **Reputation System**: Assign reputation points based on user activity (e.g., uploads, purchases).
- **Badges and Achievements**: Reward users with badges for completing tasks.
- **Leaderboard**: Rank users based on their reputation points or activity.
- **Challenges and Quests**: Introduce challenges to encourage specific actions.

### 6. **Subscription Model**
- Allow users to subscribe to datasets for **recurring payments**.
- Implement subscription logic in smart contracts.

### 7. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Provide sellers with insights into dataset performance (e.g., views, purchases).
- Display analytics using charts (e.g., **Chart.js**).

### 8. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**
- Enable interoperability with other blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
- Use bridges or cross-chain protocols to transfer assets and data.
